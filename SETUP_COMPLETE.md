## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build succeeded with warnings?

The "Unauthorized" errors during build are **expected** when using placeholder credentials. Once you add real Shopify credentials, these will disappear.

### Products not showing?

1. Add credentials to `.env.local`
2. Add products in Shopify admin
3. Make sure products are on "Online Store" channel
4. Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)

### Need more help?

- See `SHOPIFY_SETUP.md` for Shopify help
